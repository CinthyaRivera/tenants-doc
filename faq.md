# Frequently Asked Questions

* We like the organization and formatting of the Developer Studio site, are there templates that can be shared?
  * You provide the doc & apis & the Studio provides everything else.  You use regular markdown or our flavor of markdown to draft your documents. https://developer.fiserv.com/support/docs/?path=docs/md/basic-syntax.md

* Who is eligible to post their APIs on the Developer Studio?
  * Anyone.  It’s for the whole company.

* What is the Developer Studio on-boarding process?
  * You can read about that here: github.com/fiserv/tenants-doc

* Do you have insight to the corporate vision for whether https://docs.firstdata.com/ and https://developer.fiserv.com will live on in parallel or eventually converge?
  * Will converge in the end.  For now, as we transition your content you’ll have both until you get enough feature parity and then you’ll shutdown the old portal.
